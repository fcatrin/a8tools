# a8tools - Atari 800 tools

This is a set of tools to learn and modify machine language code for the Atari 800.
Currently the tools are:
* [patcher](https://github.com/fcatrin/a8tools/tree/master/patcher) : A simple patcher that takes a XEX file and text file with intructions to create a new modified XEX file
* [a8disam](https://github.com/fcatrin/a8tools/tree/master/disasm) : A powerful disassembler to create a buildable ASM file with full labels, comments and more.

I know there are similar tools available but I wanted to have something that I can modify at will. Also I wanted
the tools to run natively on Linux and/or Unix systems.

These tools have been used to improve the game Screaming Wings for Atari. There is a [full post (in spanish) about the methods used to create a better version of this game](http://franco.arealinux.cl/2020/06/a8tools-y-como-mejorar-screaming-wings-para-atari-800/).
